Our project is going to be a simple Wordle game, similar to the one that is 
popular right now. We are going to have 2 or 3 difficulty levels, each one has a different amount of guesses, which is what determines the challenge level of the game for the player.

The implementation will include a dictionary of five letter words, a GUI for gameplay, and game logic to return feedback to the user as they guess

Have fun.
